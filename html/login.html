                form: This HTML tag defines the form element where users can input their credentials (username, password).
                The 'action' attribute is set to "#" temporarily. When you have a backend for handling authentication,
                the 'action' attribute will point to the relevant URL. 
                The 'method' attribute is set to "post", which means the form data will be sent securely to the server.
                aria-label is used to enhance accessibility, providing a label to the form for screen readers.

                    label: This tag provides a text label for the input field. The 'for' attribute associates the label 
                    with the specific input field by matching its ID.
                    input (text): The text input field for entering the username. The 'id' and 'name' attributes are 
                    used to identify this field and process the data when submitted. 
                    'placeholder' shows the default text inside the field, and 'required' makes the field mandatory.

                <!-- PASSWORD FIELD
                    label: Label for the password input field, similar to the username field.
                    input (password): This input type masks the characters the user types, ensuring privacy.
                    'required' attribute ensures that the field cannot be left empty.

                    button: The form submission button. When clicked, it submits the form data to the server (or backend) 
                    for processing. The 'class' attribute is used to apply button-specific styling.
                -->
